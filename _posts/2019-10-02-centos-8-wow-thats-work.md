# CentOS 8, Wow that work!

CentOS 8 has been [released](https://wiki.centos.org/About/Building_8). The [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/centos) has also been updated, somewhere on the 2nd of October 2019.

That means it's time to update **all** roles. Phew.

I prepared the bootstrap role earlier so that should be ready soon.

All other roles have references to CentOS 6 and have specific missing packages for CentOS 8.

Most roles have Fedora support, so I can probably steal a lot of patterns from the Fedora sections.

Still, I expect all of October to be fixing stuff.
